# Deutsche Bank Financial KPI Dashboard

This is a project where I built an interactive Financial KPI dashboard for Deutsche Bank using Azure SQL Database and Power BI to analyse their financial performance from 2015 to 2017.

### ðŸ”· Why I built this
I wanted to practice creating executive-level financial dashboards that show:

Revenue trends

Net profit analysis

Expenses breakdown

Liquidity & leverage insights

while combining SQL data cleaning and KPI calculations with Power BI visual storytelling â€“ a crucial skillset for finance and BI analyst roles.

### ðŸ”· Dataset used
Source: Kaggle â€“ Deutsche Bank Financial Performance

Period: Jan 2015 onwards

Key columns: Revenue, Net Income, Expenses, Profit Margin %, Cash Flow, Debt-to-Equity, Date, among others

### ðŸ”· My Project Workflow

#### 1. Data Cleaning (SQL)
Imported the raw CSV into Azure SQL Database via SSMS

Filtered data for records from 2015 onwards

Created calculated columns for:

Gross Profit = Operating Income â€“ Expenses

Profit Margin % = (Net Income / Revenue) * 100

#### 2. KPI Calculations
Example SQL snippet for KPIs:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  Date,
  (Operating_Income - Expenses) AS Gross_Profit,
  CASE WHEN Revenue = 0 THEN 0 ELSE (Net_Income * 100.0 / Revenue) END AS Profit_Margin_Percent
FROM financials_cleaned;

#### 3. Power BI Modelling
Connected the cleaned SQL table to Power BI

Built DAX measures for:

Total Revenue

Total Net Income

Total Expenses

Total Gross Profit

Avg Profit Margin %

Total Cash Flow

Avg Debt-to-Equity Ratio

#### 4. Dashboard Design
I structured the visuals as:

â€¢ Top row: KPI cards for quick executive snapshot
â€¢ Middle row:

Line chart for Monthly Revenue trend

Clustered column chart comparing Revenue vs Net Income by year
â€¢ Bottom row:

Gauge chart for Profit Margin %

Card for Debt-to-Equity Ratio

Line chart for Cash Flow trends
â€¢ Right side: Date slicers for easy filtering

### ðŸ”· Key Insights from this dashboard
Revenue peaked in mid-2016 while Net Income remained stable overall

Average profit margin was healthy (~42%) indicating strong operational efficiency

Cash Flow trends were positive, reflecting good liquidity

Debt-to-Equity ratio stayed within an optimal range, showing balanced leverage

### Tools used
